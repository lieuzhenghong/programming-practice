# Self-introduction

I'm Zhenghong and I've just graduated from the University of Oxford
where I read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.
Despite what my degree might suggest,
I've always been incredibly interested in computer science and so I've done courses
in algos and DS, computer architecture, functional programming
and so on.

Previously, I built an Electron app for a civil engineering firm
which streamlined their building inspection process a lot.
It saved about 300 engineer-hours a month.
I found this very rewarding because I could see directly how my app improved
their workflow and delighted the engineers.
I also really like designing and building systems with measurable impact.
In a previous internship I designed and built an automated SMS sender.
It uses Bayesian statistics and unique tracking URLs to send optimal reminder
messages.
Seeing the number of active users increase day-by-day was really wonderful.

I always have a backlog of new ideas and love building side projects.
I'm currently building a real-time, multiplayer board game engine
with TypeScript, React, and ExpressJS. The work OGP does aligns very well
with my own desire to build things that matter and make users' lives better.

"Hi I’m Yangshun and I graduated from National University of Singapore in
2015 with a degree in Computer Science. My interests are in Front End
ngineering and I love to create beautiful performant products with
delightful user experiences.

Back in school, I designed and built a web application, NUSMods which solves
a huge problem of class and timetable planning every semester. It receives
over a million pageviews a month and is used by over 40,000 NUS students and
even some professors. It is built using a modern web technology stack -
React, Redux, Jest, Babel, Flow, webpack and is mobile-responsive."

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Facebook because I have been
using Facebook Open Source Front End technologies for a while now and am
inspired by Facebook's mission and Open Source culture.

Question: what sort of projects are you most interested in
What kind of work do you see yourself doing
What gets you up in the morning
What sorts of projects are you most interested in
Tell me about yourself: what points to hit?

1. Weave a narrative based on previous internship experiences
2. Walk through the resume in chronological order

Feedback: for a conversation, it's too much detail in too little time
Describe the project in such a way as to invite logical follow up questions that you want

STAR framework: situation, task, action, result

The elevator pitch#

An "elevator pitch" originates from a journalist trying to pitch an idea to
an editor. The only time to catch the editor was in the elevator and she had
only around 30 seconds to do so. The key elements of elevator pitches
include:

Short - You have limited time! Direct - As you only have limited time, you
should get to the point Attention-grabbing - Present your most attractive
ideas

Whether you're at a job fair with hundreds of other candidates and you have
limited time or you are simply explaining who you are to a potential
connection or client, it is important to be able to clearly and accurately
describe your knowledge and skillset quickly and succinctly. Your self
introduction is an elevator pitch for yourself!

Here are some tips to develop a good elevator pitch for yourself: Short basic
background information#

Include who you are, who you work for (or school and major), and what you do.

For internships, you should mention the following: name, school and major,
focus areas, past internships and/or noteworthy projects. For full-time
roles, you should mention the following: name, past companies, noteworthy
projects (best if it's a public consumer product that they might have heard
of).

Does this look familiar? It is similar to your resume! Your resume is a
condensed version of your knowledge and experiences and your self
introduction is essentially a condensed version of your resume. As you grow
older, professional experience becomes more important and school background
becomes less important. Hence your self introduction changes as you become
more senior. KISS (Keep It Simple and Sweet)#

Tell them some highlights from your favorite/most impressive projects and
including some numbers if they're impressive or challenges that you've
overcome. Do not delve into the depths of how you reverse engineered a game
and decrypted a packet to predict when to use your DKP on a drop. Tell them
the executive summary: "I reverse engineered X game by decrypting Y packet to
predict Z." If this catches their interest, they will ask further questions
on their own. Why do they want you?#

Tell the interviewer why you would make a good hire. Is your experience
relevant to the company? Have you used a similar tech stack as the company or
built relevant products? What unique talent(s) do you have that may give them
confidence about your ability to contribute to the company? Practice!#

Lastly, you must practice your pitch! Having a great, succinct summary of
your skills only helps if you can actually deliver it rapidly! You should
practice keeping a quick but easy-to-follow pace that won't overwhelm them
but won't bore them. It's a precarious balance, but can be ironed out with
practice.

After coming up with your self introduction, keep it somewhere where you can
refer/tweak in future Memorize them and in future you can just use it when
you need to But don’t sound like you’re recalling it from your memory when
you’re actually saying it out. Sound natural!

Having an elevator pitch on hand is a great way to create a network and
happen upon new job opportunities. There will often be times when you can't
prepare for an interview or meeting, and it is incredibly handy to have a
practiced pitch.

lieu, [05.10.20 00:06] Format#

Prepare a self introduction that follows the following outline (inspired by
"Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle McDowell):

A sentence about your current or most recent role. A few sentences about your
(academic) background. What did you focus on? Some sentences about your
professional experience after school/university. Where did you work? What
projects did you deal with? What were the typical challenges and tasks? Which
technologies did you use? Finish with a statement saying why you are seeking
a new job opportunity and why you are interested in the role you applied for.

Breakdown#

"I love to create beautiful performant products with delightful user
experiences." Qualities that a Front End engineer should possess "It receives
over a million pageviews a month and is used by over 30,000 NUS
undergraduates and even some professors." Mention something about the project
which stands out "It is built using a modern web technology stack - React,
Redux, Jest, Babel, Flow, webpack and is mobile-responsive." Facebook tech
stack! Also hints that you are familiar with modern web technologies

Example 2: Front End Engineer at Lyft# Self introduction#

"Hi I’m Yangshun and I graduated from National University of Singapore in
2015 with a degree in Computer Science. My interests are in Front End
Engineering and I love to create beautiful performant products with
delightful user experiences.

I previously worked at Grab where I led the Grab for Work project. Grab for
Work was a service for companies to make corporate transportation expenses
convenient. Companies can create employee groups, set ride policies and share
corporate payment methods with their employees. I built the project with
another engineer over the period of 3 months on a React/Redux and Golang
stack."

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Lyft because I like working
in this ridesharing space and creating products for users to improve their
life.

Breakdown#

"I love to create beautiful performant products with delightful user
experiences." Same as above, qualities that a Front End engineer should
possess. "I previously worked at Grab where I led the Grab for Work project."
Lyft is Grab's sister company! In fact they even had a partnership in the
past. Most Lyft engineers would have heard of Grab before and mentioning this
catches their attention. "I built the project with another engineer over the
period of 4 months on a React/Redux and Golang stack." Acknowledge that you
work with others. Building a non-trivial system with just 2 people in 3
months is quite good for a non-trivial system. Lyft also uses Golang for
their high performance systems.
