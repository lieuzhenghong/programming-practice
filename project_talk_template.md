# Introduction

I've confirmed the interview date with OGP on 7th October 2020, 4pm to 6pm.

> We will be looking at your resume and getting you to share more about what
> you have worked on in the past. We’re interested in depth instead of breadth,
> so err on the side of specificity. Be prepared to share technical details
> about what you’ve worked on, including drawing diagrams on the whiteboard if
> necessary (for on-site interviews).

> In particular, we’re trying to answer the following questions about you:
>
> - What did you do?
> - How is it impressive?
> - How did you do it?

> In addition, we’re very interested in finding out how you think and how you
> work, so it would be useful to come prepared to explain any interesting
> engineering decisions that you had to make in the course of your work.

So what I'm going to do:

1. Keep practicing leetcode (but i think this is lower priority atm)
2. Write "talking points" for each of my projects:
   - what was it?
   - why was it important?
   - what was the architecture?
     - prepare diagram, talk about data flow.
     - what was the stack?
     - what were the interesting technical decisions I
       made?
   - any interesting technical challenges?
   - what mistakes did I make/what would I change if I were doing it now?
   - what have I learned?
3. Prepare answers to behavioural questions:
   - favourite project?
   - tell me about a time you had a disagreement/made a mistake ...
